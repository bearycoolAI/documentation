We deployed an updated PHP image with no impact for our users.

  * Composer 2.8.4
  * PHP 8.4.2 support
  * symfony-cli 5.10.5
  * Linux kernel 6.11.6
  * Redirection.io agent

You can now use `8.4` as `CC_PHP_VERSION` environment variable, `8.3` is still the default for now.

Only some extensions support PHP 8.4 for now: apcu, event, imap,  memcache, mongodb, pspell, rdkafka, redis, ssh2, tideways, uploadprogress, zip. We'll add support for more extensions as they are released.
